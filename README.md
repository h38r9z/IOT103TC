IOT103TC: Computer Architecture and Operating System 
Individual Coursework, CW1 (40%) 
Exploring the Depths: Digital Circuit Design, Assembly Language, and Computer Memory Systems
Students    will    write    an      individual      research      essay      (no      more      than      2000      words)   individually as the coursework that will consist   of three   main   parts:
• Part A:   Logic circuit   design.
•          Part   B:   (Microprocessor without Interlocked   Pipelined   Stages)   MIPS   Assembly   Language.
•          Part   C:   Computer   Memory   Management.
Please follow the subsequent instructions while   preparing your   report:
A. Logic circuit design. (30 Marks) 
1.    Explain   the   principles   of   D   latch   and   D   flip-flop,   and   draw   their   truth   tables.   Why   does   the   flip-flop   have   feedback?   What   happens   if   two   inverters   are   directly connected end to   end?   (10   Marks)
2.   What   happens   if   an   odd   number   of   inverters   are   connected   end   to   end,   and   what   happens   if   an   even   number   of   inverters   are   connected   end   to   end? (   10   Marks)
3.    Given a square wave with an input frequency of 1000, design a circuit to reduce   the output frequency   by   half.   (10   Marks)
B. MIPS Assembly Language. (40 Marks) 
1.    Select two simple algorithms, such   as   calculating   the   factorial   of   a   number   or   finding    the      maximum    代 写IOT103TC: Computer Architecture and Operating SystemPython

2.   Translate the algorithm into machine code instructions, considering the specific   architecture and   instruction set of a chosen   processor.   (10   Marks)
3.    Provide   the   machine   code   algorithm   (source   code)   as   part   of the   essay,   with   line   numbers.   Provide   a   step-by-step   explanation   of   how   the   algorithm    is   executed in machine code, including the use   of   registers,   memory   access,   and   control flow   instructions. (10   Marks)
C. Computer Memory Management. (30 Marks) 
Virtualization   is one of the   biggest   improvements   in   modern computer architecture.
1.    Briefly explain the concept of   virtual memory in modern computer architecture.   (10   Marks)
2.    Discuss the advantages of virtual   memory   in   modern computing. (   10   Marks)
3.    Discuss   the   advantages   of   cache   memory   in   modern   computer   systems   and   Outline the disadvantages of   cache   memory. (   10   Marks)
Submission Guidelines: 
• Prepare the   report documenting your   answers, findings   and   analysis.
•            Include       clear       explanations,       diagrams,       and       examples      to      support      your   descriptions and   implementations.
• Properly   cite and   reference   any   external   sources   used.
•          Format the   utilized   references according to   the   specified   guidelines   (e.g.,   APA   style).
This   coursework   must   be   submitted   via   the   Learning   Mall   online   - no later than 23:59 time on the following date: 7th of December, 2024 (China Time GMT+8).
